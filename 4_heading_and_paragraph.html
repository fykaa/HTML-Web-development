    # HEADINGS

    Let us begin with the simple heading tags. 
    There are basically six types of heading tags ranging from
     <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. 
    These are the six heading tags from h1 being the largest font size 
    and h6 being the smallest font size. There is an important you should 
    know about H1 tags. In every website there is only one <h1> tag, 
    which is the main heading of the website. You should never write the normal 
    paragraph text as headings just to make it bold. It is advised that 
    using <h1> tag only once will help in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) 
    of a website and even ranking it higher in different search engines. 
    
    # PARAGRAPH
    
    Then comes the paragraph tag which is denoted by <p>. 
    Whenever we want to add a paragraph on our website then we can simply use 
    paragraph tag in the format-

    <p>some random texts</p>

    To write a new paragraph, simply jump on a new line and start writing the 
    new paragraph in a paragraph tag. To get 4 different lines of paragrapgh tag,
    we can simply write p*4. 

    Let us now discuss the main advantage of emmet abbreviation. 
    If we want some random texts up to any number of words then we can either 
    copy from any article from the Internet or just write random words, 
    which of course will not look good. To avoid this, we can write lorem 
    and the number of words we want in a paragraph. 
    Let us understand with an example-
    <p>Lorem40</p>
    This code will give us a paragraph of 40 words.


    The next tags that we are going to see are <strong> and <em> (emphasized) tags. 
    Writing some texts between strong tags will make that portion of the text as bold. 
    And writing any text between em tags, will convert that part as Italic. 
    However, these texts can later be changed with the help of CSS.

    Now to change a line in a paragraph we can easily use the <br> tag. 
    It is a self-closing tag which helps to break a line. 
    However, using too many <br> tags is not good for practice. 
    We will discuss this more when we are going to learn CSS.

    <p>first<br><br><br><br>This is a new line</p>

    Then the next tag is the <hr> tag which is also a self-closing tag. 
    It helps to add a horizontal ruler like a line on the webpage. 

    Apart from these there are also Bold and Italic tags but it
    is recommened to use them in HTML 5. 
    It is recommended to use strong and em tags instead.
