Introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript & How websites work? | Web Development
I started this course as an attempt to teach you web development in a fun, easy way! 
The aim of this course is to teach you how to build a high-quality, responsive, and modern website 
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this course, you will learn about all the technologies involved in web development. 
This course is going to benefit all those 
students who do not know anything and are new to this field. You will get complete knowledge of HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript. You will get full information from scratch about web development. 
Also, those who already have some knowledge can go through the course to learn even further 
as there are a lot of advanced websites that we will look into by the end of this course.

Now let us first understand what HTML, CSS, and Javascript are for? 
For every website to be designed, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a must. 
This is the skeleton of a website. Without it, no website can run. 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds beauty to that website and 
JavaScript adds the brain to allow the functioning of that website. 
Therefore, CSS and JavaScript add beauty and brain to a particular website respectively. 

Let us now take another example of a car. The HTML acts as the metallic body of a car and the 
CSS acts as the color and design of the car. Finally, the engine of a car is like the 
JavaScript on the website to add functionality. 

Normally, a client or a user sends a request to the webserver of the website,he wants to visit. 
The web server that has its own IP address stores all the files in the backend which can be written in PHP,
Python, or Node.js. The web server sends a response to the client in the form of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Finally, to understand-
#HTML- skeleton/body- is used as a standard language for any website design. It acts as a static skeleton to a web application. Itâ€™s a well-standardized system.
#CSS- looks/parts- is used to handle the presentation of the web page. It makes the website look attractive and beautiful.
#JavaScript- functions/brain- allows scripting on your website and makes it completely dynamic in nature. It provides front end scripting for your website and is a high-level dynamic interpreted programming language.

Now, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have a lot of concepts in them which we will take over through 
the span of this course. Therefore, it cannot be learned all at once. If you are a beginner, 
learning HTML up to 80%, CSS up to 40-60%, and JavaScript up to 50-70% will be more than enough 
to start building websites. This is something nobody in the web development industry talks about and 
hence I thought to share this personal advice with all of you.  Please don't get me wrong when I say that.
Once you have learned and understood the bare minimum to build a website you can come back to the course
 and start watching it once again for perfecting and sharpening the already learned concepts. 
 Sometimes following this practice gets difficult, the good news is that once you start watching 
 these videos and get your hands dirty with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
 the rest you will gradually learn based upon your practices and experiences with the help of projects 
 I have designed as a part of this. You need to learn all the concepts simultaneously and co-relate all 
 the things by practicing them.
