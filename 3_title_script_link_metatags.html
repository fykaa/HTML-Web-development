    Title, Script, Link, and Meta Tags

    In the last tutorial, we have learned how the basic structure of a website looks like. 
    In this HTML tutorial, we are going to learn about title, scripts, links, and Meta tags. 
    We will make a new file as “hello.html” and then use basic emmet abbreviation as told 
    previously to get the boilerplate HTML template.



#METATAGS____________________________________________________________________________________
    (@ metatags head ke andar aata hai)
The Meta Tags are used to define the Meta data in an HTML. 
They are mainly used in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) techniques which help any particular 
website to rank better in Google or different search engines. It simply boosts the ranking 
of a webpage to get more traffic on any website.

So let us understand various meta tags:
1) 
<meta charset= “UTF-8”>
    It simply means that the characters that are used will be of UTF-8.
    It declares the page’s character encoding. It should contain a standard IANA MIME name for 
    character encodings. Moreover, authors are encouraged to use UTF-8. 

2)
<meta name= “viewport” content= “width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    This tag is used to make your website responsive and adjust its width 
    in such a way that it looks good in both PC or mobile. 
    It helps in making the website mobile friendly also.

3)
<meta http-equiv= “X-UA-Compatible” content= “ie=edge”>
    
It helps any particular website to open in the highest compatibility 
    mode available. It is mostly for those who are still using Internet Explorer. 
    Because there are still some people who have not upgraded their system 
    and are still using the older versions.

To add descriptions and keywords on our website, we still use meta tags:

<meta name= “description” content = “This is a description”>
- To add a description, we have to write the above statement 
    and write your own description in the content part.

<meta name= “keywords” content= “html tutorial, css tutorial”>
- Keywords are those special words through which a user reach any website. 
    You can add the keywords in the content part of the tag.

If we want our website to be indexed in Google or other search engines 
and bots should follow all the links present on the website, then we have to write-
<meta name= “robots” content= “INDEX, FOLLOW”>

#LINKS_______________________________________________________________________________

To link our stylesheets named as “harry.css” in the HTML code, we have to write-
<link rel= “stylesheet” href= “harry.css”>

In the same way, as we have included CSS, we can also include a JavaScript file in <head> tag.
<script src = “harry.js”></script>
