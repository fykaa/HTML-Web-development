<!--Basic Structure of a Website

The HTML code contains some sections such as DOCTYPE, meta tags, head, and body. 
All the tags that we include in an HTML file, needs to be first opened and then closed by angular brackets. 
Let us now understand different sections one by one.

1)
Doctype HTML- Doctype HTML justifies that it is a HTML document. 
So, we are defining specifically for a browser to understand that it is an HTML document. 
2)
<html lang= “en”> - It is the opening part of the HTML tag that tells us the language of the
     document is in English.
3)
<head> - Head contains all the meta-tags in it which is used to describe the contents of a website.
    Meta means providing information about information. 
    Therefore, meta tags are used to define the keywords and descriptions on our website. 
    Head also contains the title of the website and all the external files like CSS and 
    JavaScript that we link to it.
    i.e. metatag, title, links, description is under head
4)
<body> - Body contains all the contents of the webpage in it. 
    However, in the beginning, our website may look a little uglier but after including 
    stylesheets it will start looking attractive.


Sometimes we want to write a particular thing that we do not want the browser to take it as a part of code. 
So, we can include it in the comments by writing “< !-- Your text -- >” in this format. 
However, there is a shortcut to convert any text into comments. 
You need to press “Ctrl + / (forward slash)” to convert any texts into comments. 


I believe you must have understood until now about how the basic structure of a website looks like.
You will not face any type of difficulties if you follow the step by step process as told. 
Mostly, the coding part will be done under the body section.
